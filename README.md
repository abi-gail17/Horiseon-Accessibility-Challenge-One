# Horiseon-Accessibility-Challenge-One
Challenge 1 for UofT Coding bootcamp. Assignment to learn about Agile Software development and accessibility in coding. I was given base code and had to refactor it so it was more accesible and redundant code was removed.

## Description
Added semantic html and alt tags to images to make it more accessible

Commented the css to describe its function and condensed repetitive css
